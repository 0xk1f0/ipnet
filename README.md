This module provides types and methods for working with IPv4 and IPv6 network addresses. It aims for alignment with the `IpAddr`, `Ipv4Addr`, and `Ipv6Addr` types in Rust's standard library.

The module includes extension traits to add Add, Sub, BitAnd, and BitOr operations to `Ipv4Addr` and `Ipv6Addr`.
